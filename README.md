### Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles which basically contain configuration that I use across multiple systems (Linux and MacOS).

It mainly contains a custom ZSH setup with some useful plugins and a bunch of Brew packages that will be installed.


### Installation

Just run
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pataar/dotfiles.git && \
	cd dotfiles && \
	./install.sh
```
